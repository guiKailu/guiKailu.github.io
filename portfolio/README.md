### Front End
Projects written in HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, and React. Examples include a product page, a calculator, a pomodoro timer, and a drum machine.


### Back-end
The apis-and-microservices directory includes code in Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The projects include an URL shortener, an exercise tracker, and more.

### Data Visualization
D3.js provides endless posibilities for graphing data in unique and interactive ways. In this directory, I demonstrate a bar chart, a cloropleth map, a treemap, and a scatterplot app.
